## Readings
* Read [BST interview questions](https://khan4019.github.io/front-end-Interview-Questions/bst.html)

## Outline

### What is a Tree?
Trees are a widely used data structure that simulate a hierarchical "tree" structure. These data structures contain a **root**, which may or may not contain a series of child sub-trees. They can also be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, which starts at the root node and each node is a data structure consisting of a value and an array of references to any child nodes. Trees are also considered to be a directed, acyclic, connected graph.

### Breaking Down A Tree
Common components of a tree include:
* **root:** - the top node in a tree
* **child:** - a node that's a direct sub-tree of another node
* **siblings:** - a group of nodes with the same parent
* **leaf:** - a node with node children

### Useful Implementations of Trees
Trees are often used to implement the following:
* the DOM
* a computer file system
* sorting and searching
